                    [/?]

Where:
  BackupOption    - Value indicating whether or not to backup the
                    original file.
                    Choices are 0-No; 1-Yes.
                    Default is 0.
  dir             - If specified, the current working directory name is printed.
  FindPattern     - Pattern to find. If the % character appears anywhere, and
                    this file is being run from a batch file, make sure to
                    escape it with a second %. If not running in a batch file,
                    the second escape is not needed. When including double
                    quote in a quoted string pattern, double up on the quote
                    characters. For example, a search for "Data Point" should
                    be expressed as ""Data Point"".
  PatternFilename - Name of the JSON find and replace data file to use.
