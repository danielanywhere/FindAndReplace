                    [/wait]
Where:
  BackupOption    - Value indicating whether or not to backup the
                    original file.

  dir             - If specified, the current working directory name is printed.
  FindPattern     - Pattern to find. If the % character appears anywhere, and
                    this file is being run from a batch file, make sure to
                    escape it with a second %. If not running in a batch file,
                    the second escape is not needed. When including double

  PatternFilename - Name of the JSON find and replace data file to use.
                    The object format of this file is as follows:
                    [
                      {
                        "Name": "GeneralName",
                        "GroupFindPattern": "PatternString",
                        "FindPattern": "PatternString",
                        "ReplacePattern": "PatternString",

                        "UseRegEx": 1|0,
                        "Remarks": "GeneralRemarks"
                      },

                    ... where
                    GroupFindPattern - A pattern used to separate the file into
                    distinct groups before performing find and replace on those
                    sections.
                    FindPattern - The pattern of string to find.
                    ReplacePattern - The replacement pattern to apply,
                    including the 'LoadFileContent(filename)' function, where
                    applicable.
                    FileReplacePatterns - Collection of Filename and Pattern
                    entries to use when replacements are distinct according to
                    the filename of the currently open file. Consider using
                    this parameter for features like Previous and Next button
                    linking, where each page contains different specific
                    details for similar functions.
                    UseRegEx - Value indicating whether to use regular
                    expressions (1) or explicit text find and replace (0).
  RegexOption     - Value indicating whether or not to use Regex.
                    Choices are 0-No; 1-Yes.

  TestArgument    - If specified, the argument expressed on the command line is
                    repeated back as parsed. Use this parameter to determine
                    how escaped patterns are interpreted.
  VariableNameAndValue  -   Name and value in the pattern of {Name},{Value}
  wait            - If specified, the application will wait for user input
                    after finishing but before exiting.
  WorkingPath     - Fully qualified directory name without a filename in which
                    the files will be opened when a relative name is
                    specified.
